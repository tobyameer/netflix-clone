# Netflix Clone 
Netflix clone using MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node).\
I built a full-stack Netflix clone using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) for the back-end, with Firebase for storing movie-related content and MongoDB for user authentication and for storing movie data. I used Tailwind CSS to build a responsive and sleek UI, and I tested and debugged the backend APIs using Postman. The project mimics the Netflix experience by allowing users to browse movies, view details, and watch trailers. I integrated Firebase for storing movie data and used JWT-based authentication for secure user login.


## Skills
1. React.js (Components, State Management, React Router)
2. Node.js & Express (API development, server-side logic)
3. MongoDB & Mongoose (Database design, data interaction)
4. JWT Authentication (User authentication, session management)
5. Postman (API testing, debugging)
6. Axios (API data fetching)
7. HTML/CSS (Responsive design, layout with Flexbox/Grid)
8. Deployment (Heroku, Netlify, MongoDB Atlas)

## Technologies Used
1. Frontend:
  * React.js: Used for building a dynamic, component-based UI. I utilized React Router to handle navigation between different sections (home page, movie details, login, etc.).
  * Tailwind CSS: Applied for styling the components. Tailwindâ€™s utility classes allowed me to create responsive and customizable layouts quickly and maintain consistency throughout the app.
  * Axios: Used for making HTTP requests to the backend and interacting with APIs (e.g., fetching movie data, sending user credentials for authentication).
React Context API (Optional): Managed global state such as the current user and authentication status.
Backend:

Node.js & Express.js: Used to build the backend server and create RESTful APIs to handle user authentication and fetch movie data from the databases (Firebase and MongoDB).
JWT Authentication: Implemented JSON Web Tokens to secure the API and authenticate users. This ensured that only logged-in users could access certain features, such as saving movie preferences or viewing personalized data.
MongoDB: Used for storing user data, including authentication details (usernames, hashed passwords) and user preferences like liked movies.
Database:

Firebase Firestore: Used to store movie data (titles, descriptions, images, trailers) for fast, scalable access.
MongoDB: Used for user data storage, which includes authentication details, user preferences, and JWT tokens.
API Testing (Postman):

Postman: A key tool used for testing the backend APIs. I created and tested various API routes for user login, sign-up, and fetching movie data to ensure they were working correctly before integrating them into the front-end. I also used Postman to simulate authentication and test the secure endpoints.
Deployment:

Netlify: Deployed the React front-end on Netlify, enabling easy hosting and continuous integration.
Heroku: Deployed the Node.js backend to Heroku, allowing the API to handle requests from the front-end and interact with MongoDB and Firebase.
Firebase Hosting (Optional): Used for storing static content like images, media, and movie-related resources.
Development Process:
Planning & Setup: "I started by planning the core features of the app: user authentication, movie data management, and a dynamic UI. I set up the backend with Node.js and Express.js and integrated MongoDB for user data. Meanwhile, I created the front-end with React and designed the UI using Tailwind CSS."

Building the APIs & Testing with Postman: "Once the backend was set up, I created the APIs for user authentication (sign-up, login), fetching movie data, and handling user preferences. I used Postman to test these APIs, making sure they returned correct data, handled errors properly, and were secure. This testing phase was crucial in ensuring that everything worked before connecting the back-end to the front-end."

Frontend Development: "I built the front-end using React.js, creating components for the homepage, movie details modal, and the login page. I used React Router for navigation and dynamic content rendering. I connected the front-end with the backend using Axios, making sure that movie data was fetched properly and user authentication was functioning as expected."

Integration & Final Testing: "After integrating the front-end and back-end, I tested the full workflow from user login to movie browsing and trailer viewing. I ensured the app was responsive by testing it on different screen sizes and devices. I also conducted additional testing on the Postman to simulate real-world usage scenarios."

Deployment: "Once the app was ready, I deployed the front-end on Netlify and the back-end on Heroku. I also made sure to configure MongoDB and Firebase properly for production use."

Challenges Faced:
Managing Authentication: "Implementing secure JWT authentication for user sessions was one challenge. Ensuring that the JWT tokens were securely stored and validated across different pages required careful integration between the front-end and back-end."

Fetching and Displaying Data Dynamically: "Handling dynamic movie data from Firebase and MongoDB posed challenges when ensuring that data was displayed correctly in the React components. I had to manage state efficiently to ensure that data was loaded asynchronously and updated in real-time."

Responsive Design: "While using Tailwind CSS helped with styling, making the app fully responsive across different devices required fine-tuning the layout and ensuring that the interface worked on both small screens (mobile) and large screens (desktop)."

Conclusion:
"This Netflix clone was a great project to solidify my full-stack development skills. I gained hands-on experience with the MERN stack, Firebase, Tailwind CSS, and JWT authentication, and learned how to integrate front-end and back-end technologies effectively. Testing the APIs with Postman and using MongoDB for user data storage were essential in building a secure and scalable app. This project gave me a deep understanding of how modern web applications work and how to build a complete, end-to-end system."
